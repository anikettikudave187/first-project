# first-project
snakeAndLadder
i have created snake and ladder game with use of Javafx. this is my first ever begginer level project in which i worked on. i used javafx inbuilt methods and got hands on experience which has given me lil bit more confidence to go forward.

#logic we are used board with x and y coordinates in javafx. we used snake and ladder picture to make game complete. we have used player class, board class, dice class to operate with the components of the game; also we used lil bit animation to make players go ahead and with dice value;
